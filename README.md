 # What our project focuses on:

- <b>Enhanced Security</b>: Medical records contain sensitive information, and their security is critical. Blockchain technology can provide secure storage of medical records by using encryption and decentralized storage, which makes it difficult for unauthorized individuals to access or modify data.

- <b>Increased Privacy</b>: Medical records stored on a blockchain can be accessed only by authorized individuals, and the patient has control over their data. Patients can grant access to healthcare providers or researchers without compromising their privacy.

- <b>Improved Efficiency</b>: The current system of medical record keeping is often fragmented, with different providers using different systems. Blockchain technology can streamline the process of record-keeping and improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery by providing a single, shared source of truth.

- <b>Greater Transparency</b>: Blockchain technology provides a transparent and tamper-proof record of all transactions, including medical records. This can enhance trust between patients and healthcare providers and reduce the risk of errors or fraud.

- <b>Better Access to Data</b>: Blockchain technology can facilitate the sharing of medical records between different healthcare providers, researchers, and patients. This can lead to better health outcomes by enabling more comprehensive and coordinated care.

Overall, storing medical records on a blockchain can improve security, privacy, accessibility, accuracy, efficiency, and interoperability in the healthcare industry.

- Here we can add the amount of <b>MATIC</b> we want to raise
- We can additionally provide with the relevant image
